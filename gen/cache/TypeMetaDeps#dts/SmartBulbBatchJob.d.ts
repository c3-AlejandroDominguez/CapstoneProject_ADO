// TypeScript definitions for the C3 type SmartBulbBatchJob

/**

 * - Creates SourceFiles for SmartBulbMeasurementSeries (unique devices)
 * - Creates SourceFiles for SmartBulbMeasurement (measurement data)
 * - Triggers data integration on all files when complete

 * - batchSize: Number of files to process per batch (default: 2)
 * - removeDigits: Whether to remove digits from device IDs (default: false)
